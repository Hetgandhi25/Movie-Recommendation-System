# Movie-Recommendation-System

A content-based movie recommendation system built in Python. This project takes a movie title as input and suggests a list of the top 5 most similar movies based on their content metadata.

**Learning Source**: This project was developed following the "Movie Recommender System Project | Content Based Recommender System with Heroku Deployment" video by CampusX on YouTube.

## Project Summary

* This project is a **content-based movie recommendation system** that suggests movies based on their content similarity.
* The system takes a **movie title** as input and returns a list of the **top 5 most similar movies** as output.
* Recommendations are generated by analyzing movie metadata, including the **overview, genres, keywords, cast, and crew**.
* The metadata is processed and combined into a unified text corpus for each movie, which is then vectorized using the **Bag-of-Words (BoW)** model.
* Movie similarity is calculated by computing the **cosine similarity** between the movie vectors.

## Dataset

This project utilizes the **TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset**. The dataset is composed of two primary files:
* `tmdb_5000_movies.csv`
* `tmdb_5000_credits.csv`

## How It Works

The recommendation engine follows a content-based filtering methodology, which involves these steps:

1.  **Data Loading and Preparation**:
    * The two CSV files are loaded into Pandas DataFrames.
    * The DataFrames are merged into a single DataFrame on the 'title' column.
    * Key columns for analysis are selected, including `movie_id`, `title`, `overview`, `genres`, `keywords`, `cast`, and `crew`.

2.  **Feature Extraction and Preprocessing**:
    * Helper functions parse the JSON-like string data in the `genres`, `keywords`, `cast`, and `crew` columns using Python's `ast` module.
    * Specific information is extracted, such as the names of the top 3 cast members and the name of the director.
    * All extracted names (like "Science Fiction") have spaces removed to be treated as single entities (e.g., "ScienceFiction").

3.  **Feature Engineering**:
    * A consolidated `tags` column is created for each movie by combining its processed `overview`, `genres`, `keywords`, `cast`, and `crew`.

4.  **Text Vectorization**:
    * The text in the `tags` column is converted to lowercase.
    * The `movie_recommendation_system.py` script uses the NLTK library's `PorterStemmer` to perform stemming on the text.
    * Scikit-learn's `CountVectorizer` is used to transform the text into a high-dimensional vector space based on the Bag-of-Words (BoW) model.
    * The vectorizer is configured to use a maximum of 5000 features (`max_features=5000`) and to remove English stop words (`stop_words='english'`).

5.  **Similarity Calculation**:
    * The cosine similarity is calculated between all movie vectors using `sklearn.metrics.pairwise.cosine_similarity`. This creates a similarity matrix.

6.  **Recommendation**:
    * A `recommend` function takes a movie title as input.
    * It finds the movie's index and uses the similarity matrix to find the 5 movies with the highest similarity scores.

7.  **Exporting**:
    * The final processed DataFrame and the similarity matrix are serialized and saved into `.pkl` files using Pickle for future use.

## Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Pandas**
* **NumPy**
* **Scikit-learn**
* **NLTK** (used for stemming in `movie_recommendation_system.py`)
* **Pickle**

## How to Run

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install the required libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `nltk`.
3.  Download the TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset and place the CSV files in the project directory.
4.  Run either `movie_recommendation_system.py` or `notebook86c26b4f17.ipynb` to generate the model files.
5.  The script will output serialized files (`movies.pkl` and `similarity.pkl`) that can be used to make recommendations.
